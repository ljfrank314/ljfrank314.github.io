                <h3>Design Philosophy: Speed Through Simplicity</h3>
                <p>Developed a manufacturing hierarchy to maximize build speed with limited resources:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3D printed if possible (brackets, spacers)</li>
                    <li>Bent sheet metal + rivets (no welding required)</li>
                    <li>Bent sheet metal + welded joints</li>
                    <li>Simple miter cuts + welding</li>
                    <li>In-house machining only when unavoidable</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This approach let us build fast and iterate faster - critical when discoveries during integration demanded immediate redesigns.</p>
                
                <h3>Level 2: Making It Work</h3>
                <p>Inherited a paper design that needed manufacturability fixes. Built the steel frame without time for FEA - pure experience-based design. Key contributions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resolved geometric interferences in CAD before cutting metal</li>
                    <li>Designed serviceable subassemblies (learned from automotive work)</li>
                    <li>Modified existing suspension hardware for 15-day endurance test</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> 30,063m traversed, A-arm mounts being the only critical failure</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                
                <h3>Level 3: Complete Chassis Overhaul</h3>
                <p>Chief engineer set new requirements: wider wheelbase for stability, larger wheels to prevent sinking in regolith, 30°/30° steering capability. My execution:</p>
                
                <h4>Structural Redesign:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Converted internal frame from steel to aluminum (weight savings for new electrical system)</li>
                    <li>Widened wheelbase through new suspension geometry</li>
                    <li>ANSYS FEA with aggressive FoS (verified against hand calcs)</li>
                    <li>Maintained top-down CAD architecture in Onshape for team coordination</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Suspension Revolution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adapted existing kinematic layout to new wheel envelope</li>
                    <li>Converted failed bolted joints to shoulder bolt system</li>
                    <li>Precision-machined components where 3D printing couldn't meet tolerances</li>
                    <li>Accommodated steering actuators for crab-walk capability</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="image-wrapper">

                </div>
                
                <h3>Integration Under Fire</h3>
                <p>Fast design meant some components were modeled just days before fabrication. This required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Constant communication with excavation/electrical teams</li>
                    <li>On-the-fly modifications when reality didn't match CAD</li>
                    <li>Balancing "perfect" vs "good enough" to meet deadlines</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The payoff:</strong> 85% excavation rate improvement enabled by a chassis that could handle the increased loads.</p>
                
                <h3>Final Results & Reflection</h3>
                <p>The rover secured 3rd place overall at NASA Marshall, validating our scrappy approach against teams with significantly larger budgets. More importantly, this project transformed my engineering practice. The PSTDL gave me the freedom to fail fast, build faster, and learn from both. Working alongside a team that trusted a junior engineer to redesign critical systems taught me that good engineering isn't about perfection - it's about making the right compromises under pressure.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>Every dent in that frame represents a lesson learned. Every redesigned bracket reflects feedback from teammates who knew their systems better than I ever could. This wasn't just a competition rover - it was 18 months of compressed engineering education that shaped how I approach every project since.</p>
