                <h3>Design Philosophy: Speed Through Simplicity</h3>
                <p>Developed a manufacturing hierarchy to maximize build speed with limited resources:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3D printed if possible (brackets, spacers)</li>
                    <li>Bent sheet metal + rivets (no welding required)</li>
                    <li>Bent sheet metal + welded joints</li>
                    <li>Square tubing + welding</li>
                    <li>In-house machining utilized only when unavoidable</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This approach let us build fast and iterate faster; critical when discoveries during integration demanded immediate redesigns. Even the most expensive option, making billet parts, was done in house by team members to save cost.</p>
                
                <h3>Level 2: Bringing PRIMROSE to Life</h3>
                <p>Inherited a conceptual design that needed manufacturability fixes. Key contributions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resolved geometric interferences in CAD before cutting metal</li>
                    <li>Designed serviceable subassemblies (learned from automotive work)</li>
                    <li>Modified existing suspension hardware for 15-day endurance test</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> 30,063m traversed, 2987.2 kg excavated and dumped</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Level 3: Huntsville or Bust</h3>
                <p>The rover was constantly down for maintenance, necessitating a rework. Worked with chief engineer and team to set new requirements, mainly: wider wheelbase for stability, larger wheels to prevent sinking in sand or regolith, 30°/30° steering capability for better maneuverability. Key contributions:</p>
                
                <h4>Structural Redesign:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Converted internal frame from steel to aluminum (weight savings + new electrical system)</li>
                    <li>Added frame brackets to accommodate larger wheels and wider wheelbase</li>
                    <li>ANSYS FEA with aggressive FoS (verified against hand calcs)</li>
                    <li>Maintained top-down CAD architecture in Onshape, enabling fast design changes</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Suspension Overhaul:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adapted existing kinematic layout geometry to new wheel envelope</li>
                    <li>Redesigned A-arm mounts and most suspension components </li>
                    <li>Modified frame to support extended wheelbase and larger wheels</li>
                    <li>Implemented 30°/30° steering angle</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Integration Under Fire</h3>
                <p>Fast design meant some components were modeled just days before fabrication. This required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Constant communication with excavation/electrical teams</li>
                    <li>On-the-fly modifications when reality didn't match CAD</li>
                    <li>Balancing "perfect" vs "good enough" to meet deadlines</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The payoff:</strong> 85% excavation rate improvement enabled by a chassis that could handle the increased loads, and 100% drivetrain reliability.</p>
                
                <h3>Final Results & Reflection</h3>
                <p>The rover secured 3rd place overall at NASA's Break the Ice Lunar Challenge, validating our scrappy approach against teams with significant industry backing. More importantly, this project transformed my engineering practice. The PSTDL gave me the freedom to fail fast and get hands on. Working alongside a team that trusted an undergrad to work as an engineer, designing and redesigning critical systems, taught me that good engineering isn't about perfection; it's about making the right compromises under pressure.</p>

        <h2>Constant Force DTVACC Mechanism</h2>
        <p class="tech-stack">Linkage Analysis • ONSHAPE • CAM • Rapid Prototyping</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>The Challenge: 4 Weeks to Enable Critical Testing</h3>
            <p>Fresh off our success at NASA's Break the Ice Challenge, the deadline to test for one client, AI SpaceFactory, was rapidly approaching. We had to design and build a mechanism to apply 10 lbs of constant force to their lunar road-paving technology for testing in the PSTDL (Planetary Surface Technology Development Lab) Dusty Thermal Vacuum Chamber (DTVACC). We had just over 4 weeks before their scheduled test date.</p>
            
            <p>While the rest of the small team worked to get our regolith bed gantry motorized, I was assigned as the sole engineer on the constant force mechanism. I was responsible for concept development through final integration. The mechanism needed to maintain a constant force across 5 inches of vertical travel to accommodate road surface variations while surviving vacuum conditions.</p>

                <img src="https://lfrank.xyz/assets/images/wheelAnimation.gif" alt="Constant force mechanism CAD model" class="project-image">
                <p class="image-caption">Final mechanism design showing lever arm and wheel assembly</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Solution: Elegant Simplicity Under Pressure</h3>
            <p>Rather than complex active control systems, I developed a purely passive mechanism that exploited two competing non-linear effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decreasing moment arm length as the wheel moves up/down</li>
                <li>Changing mechanical advantage as the transmission angle approaches 180°</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src="https://lfrank.xyz/assets/images/wheelForce.png" alt="Wheel force for a given deflection angle" class="project-image">
                <p class="image-caption">Final mechanism design showing lever arm and wheel assembly</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>By carefully tuning the torsion spring selection and lever arm geometry, these effects cancelled out to produce near-constant force (±1 lb) across the entire travel range. Spreadsheet analysis proved the concept before moving to CAD.</p>
            
            <h3>Rapid Development Timeline</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Mathematical proof of concept and spring selection</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Parametric CAD development and sheet metal orders</li>
                <li><strong>Weeks 3-4:</strong> In-house CNC machining of precision bearing blocks, assembly, and integration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The parametric, top-down CAD approach proved critical when last-minute changes were needed - including when Send Cut Send rejected our initial sheet metal design. Every component was designed for rapid fabrication: sheet metal where possible, 3D printed spacers for non-critical parts, and CNC machining only for the tiny bearing blocks that required sub-thou tolerances.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">CAM toolpath for bearing mounts</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Results & Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>The mechanism functioned well during testing, enabling AI SpaceFactory to validate their paved lunar road under realistic loading conditions. The successful test was instrumental in securing their STTR Phase 2 contract.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">Mechanism undergoing testing in the DTVACC facility</p>
            </div>

            <p>This project taught me valuable lessons about managing aggressive timelines and client expectations. While we delivered a working solution, the 12-hour days and extreme time pressure highlighted the importance of realistic project scoping. Working under tight constraints can give way to creative solutions, but also creates an environment for failure.</p>
            
            <h3>Technical Takeaway</h3>
            <p>Good engineering under pressure isn't about perfection; it's about finding elegant solutions that work within constraints. By leveraging fundamental mechanical principles instead of active control systems, we delivered a robust mechanism that met all requirements under an extremely tight deadline.</p>
